                <div>
                    <p>
                        Atlantic Titan is made up of just one person,
                        29-year-old Rob Hamilton. Rob has always enjoyed pushing
                        himself to find his limit. He has completed two
                        ultra-mountain marathons, is a climber, a technical
                        diver, a powerlifter and has travelled to 48 countries
                        so far, with a particular fascination for the Middle
                        East.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In 2016 Rob achieved a lifelong dream when he started
                        his training to become an officer in the British Army at
                        the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. However, shortly
                        after starting his training he injured his knee and was
                        medically discharged. The diagnosis – avascular necrosis
                        resulting in a partially dead knee, three months on
                        crutches and no more long-distance running.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This was certainly a shock to his system and while he
                        had always wanted to take part in the Talisker Whisky
                        Atlantic Challenge, this unfortunate turn of events
                        meant he is now more determined than ever to not only
                        complete the crossing but win the solo category. With
                        the goal of proving to himself and others that injuries
                        and life changing events need not be a barrier for
                        achieving extraordinary things.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is the premier event
                    in ocean rowing – A challenge that will take you more than
                    3000 Miles west from San Sebastian in La Gomera, Canary
                    Islands (28oN 18oW) to Nelson’s Dockyard English Harbour,
                    Antigua & Barbuda (17oN 61oW). The annual race begins in
                    early December, with over 30 teams participating from around
                    the world.

                        <h3>Sleep Deprivation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Rowing for up to 18 hours a day is exhausting,
                            giving very little time to sleep, coupled with the
                            fact that sleeping in an ocean rowing boat is often
                            quite bumpy. Ocean rowers frequently report
                            hallucinations.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Salt Sores</h3>
                        <p>
                            Salt from the ocean gets everywhere, all over your
                            skin and clothes. With nowhere to wash the salt can
                            often lead to painful sores which have the potential
                            to lead to infection.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Dehydration</h3>
                        <p>
                            With temperatures in excess of 30 degrees, no shade
                            on the boat and rowing all day, every day,
                            dehydration is a real risk. The onboard watermaker
                            is therefore a vital piece of equipment.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Waves</h3>
                        <p>
                            Waves in the Atlantic can be big, really big, up to
                            30ft (9 metres) high, in fact. This may be ok in a
                            larger ocean-going vessel but in a small 24ft (7.3
                            metres) rowing boat it can lead to capsizes.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Food</h3>
                        <p>
                            Spending all this time rowing burns a huge number of
                            calories, approximately 8000 a day. However, rowers
                            typically only manage to eat 6000 calories a day.
                            Therefore, Rob will likely lose between 10kg and
                            15kg on the crossing. This may be exacerbated by
                            bouts of sea sickness which drain energy and
                            motivation making it all that much harder.

                    which supports and empowers service personnel from around
                    the world who have suffered life changing injuries, visible
                    or otherwise. Rob has previously worked for CRP in 2018 and
                    his short stint training to be an officer in the British
                    Army has given him an appreciation of the needs of both
                    refugees and veterans.

                    In their own ways, both organisations support victims of
                    conflict. While the beneficiaries of these organisations may
                    have different backgrounds they often have similar injuries
                    and Rob is keen to draw attention to fact that while they
                    are treated as separate causes, they are often two sides of
                    the same coin.

                        <p>
                            When most people think about the refugee crisis,
                            they think of boats making dangerous journeys across
                            the Mediterranean, and families crowded into tents
                            in European camps. But the reality is that the vast
                            majority of displaced people never reach Europe.
                            This is where CRP comes in. Since 2006, CRP have
                            supported urban refugees in Amman. The organisation
                            tries to meet the immediate needs of its
                            beneficiaries by distributing food vouchers and
                            providing medical support. They give out warm
                            clothes and heaters in the winter, and
                            back-to-school supplies in September. At their
                            community centre in east Amman they offer classes
                            and activities focusing on education and trauma
                            relief.

                            On a trip to the Warrior Games in the USA in 2013,
                            HRH The Duke of Sussex saw first-hand how the power
                            of sport can help physically, psychologically and
                            socially those suffering from injuries and illness.
                            He was inspired by his visit and the Invictus Games
                            was born. The Games have been supporting wounded
                            service personnel since 2014, when the inaugural
                            Invictus Games were held in London. The organisation
                            harness’ the power of sport to inspire recovery,
                            support rehabilitation and generate a wider
                            understanding and respect for those who serve their
                            country.
