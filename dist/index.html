                            Atlantic Titan is made up of just one person,
                            29-year-old Rob Hamilton. Rob has always enjoyed
                            pushing himself to find his limit. He has completed
                            two ultra-mountain marathons, is a climber, a
                            technical diver, a powerlifter and has travelled to
                            48 countries so far, with a particular fascination
                            for the Middle East.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In 2016 Rob achieved a lifelong dream when he
                            started his training to become an officer in the
                            British Army at the Royal Military Academy
                            Sandhurst. However, shortly after starting his
                            training he injured his knee and was medically
                            discharged. The diagnosis – avascular necrosis
                            resulting in a partially dead knee, three months on
                            crutches and no more long-distance running.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This was certainly a shock to his system and while
                            he had always wanted to take part in the Talisker
                            Whisky Atlantic Challenge, this unfortunate turn of
                            events meant he is now more determined than ever to
                            not only complete the crossing but win the solo
                            category. With the goal of proving to himself and
                            others that injuries and life changing events need
                            not be a barrier for achieving extraordinary things.

                        You would be hard pressed to find a better way of
                        achieving this than to row across the Atlantic. The
                        Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is often touted as
                        the world’s toughest race and the premier event in ocean
                        rowing, and with good reason. The 3000-mile race starts
                        every December in La Gomera, the Canary Islands and
                        finishes up to three months later in Antigua. Rob will
                        be totally unsupported, carrying everything he needs for
                        the crossing on his boat and won’t leave his boat until
                        he reaches Antigua.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Rowing across the Atlantic presents many challenges;
                        <br />
                        <strong>Sleep Deprivation</strong> – Rowing for up to 18
                        hours a day is exhausting, giving very little time to
                        sleep, coupled with the fact that sleeping in an ocean
                        rowing boat is often quite bumpy. Ocean rowers
                        frequently report hallucinations.
                        <br />
                        <strong>Salt Sores</strong> – Salt from the ocean gets
                        everywhere, all over your skin and clothes. With nowhere
                        to wash the salt can often lead to painful sores which
                        have the potential to lead to infection.
                        <br />
                        <strong>Dehydration</strong> – With temperatures in
                        excess of 30 degrees, no shade on the boat and rowing
                        all day, every day, dehydration is a real risk. The
                        onboard watermaker is therefore a vital piece of
                        equipment.
                        <br />
                        <strong>Waves</strong> – Waves in the Atlantic can be
                        big, really big, up to 30ft (9 metres) high, in fact.
                        This may be ok in a larger ocean-going vessel but in a
                        small 24ft (7.3 metres) rowing boat it can lead to
                        capsizes.
                        <br />
                        <strong>Food</strong> – Spending all this time rowing
                        burns a huge number of calories, approximately 8000 a
                        day. However, rowers typically only manage to eat 6000
                        calories a day. Therefore, Rob will likely lose between
                        10kg and 15kg on the crossing. This may be exacerbated
                        by bouts of sea sickness which drain energy and
                        motivation making it all that much harder.
                        <br />
                        Overall, the mental challenge of rowing across an ocean
                        outweighs the physical. There are times during the race
                        where the water will be 5km deep and you will be closer
                        to someone in space than on land. Indeed, more people
                        have been into space than have rowed across an ocean,
                        let alone completed a solo crossing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Just making it to the start line is an impressive feat,
                        with £110,000 required to cover race costs including the
                        build and purchase of the boat from Rannoch Adventure,
                        all the navigation, emergency and communications
                        equipment as well as shipping costs, the race entrance
                        fee and mandatory courses. Rob is actively searching for
                        sponsors to join him on this incredible adventure to
                        prove that injury and life changing events do not need
                        to be a barrier to success. Information on sponsor
                        packages which start from £5,000 can be found below.

                        organisation based in Amman, Jordan, that he worked for
                        last year. CRP provides emergency aid for thousands of
                        families fleeing war zones in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and
                        Libya - amongst other countries. Beneficiaries of the
                        centre have suffered extreme setbacks in their life and
                        funds raised for CRP would help to ensure they have a
                        future to look forward to! Rob is hoping to raise
                        £50,000 for this incredible organisation.

                        <br />
                        When most people think about the refugee crisis, they
                        think of boats making dangerous journeys across the
                        Mediterranean, and families crowded into tents in
                        European camps. But the reality is that the vast
                        majority of displaced people never reach Europe. This is
                        where CRP comes in. Since 2006, CRP have supported urban
                        refugees in Amman. The organisation tries to meet the
                        immediate needs of its beneficiaries by distributing
                        food vouchers and providing medical support. They give
                        out warm clothes and heaters in the winter, and
                        back-to-school supplies in September. At their community
                        centre in east Amman they offer classes and activities
                        focusing on education and trauma relief.
